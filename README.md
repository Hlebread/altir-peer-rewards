## Troubleshooting

### Android

If the following error occurs during the installation of the build on the emulator

```bash
Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0.
```

Most likely the emulator is out of memory.

To fix it, go to **Android Studio** &rarr; **Device Manager** &rarr; **Virtual Device Configuration** &rarr; click **Show Andvaced Settings** &rarr; **Memory and Storage** section &rarr; set following values:

- RAM: 6144 Mb
- VM heap: 1024 Mb
- Internal Storage: 2048 Mb

This should be enough to successfully install the application on the emulator.

### iOS

If you face any errors during build step, try to clean build folder in Xcode and run build again.

If it doesn't work, try to reinstall **`pods`**.
Run from **`ios`** folder:

```bash
pod deintegrate && pod install
```
